This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating a common programming error: ZeroDivisionError.  The `calculate_average` function attempts to calculate the average of a list of numbers. It correctly handles empty lists by returning 0, but it could still fail with a ZeroDivisionError if the length of the list is zero. The solution demonstrates how to avoid this error using a check for empty lists.
